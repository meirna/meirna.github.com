  <h4>Making of Stablo by Nina Romić</h4>
  <p>During a period of 4 months I followed a Croatian singer-songwriter Nina Romić and her band as they were recording and rehearsing Nina’s third studio album ‘Stablo’. The video premiered in time with the concert premiere of the album. Stablo has been nominated for IMPALA’s European Independent Album of the Year Award.</p>
