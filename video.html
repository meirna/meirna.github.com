  		<p>During a period of 4 months I followed a Croatian singer-songwriter Nina Romić and her band as they were recording and rehearsing Nina’s third studio album ‘Stablo’. The video premiered in time with the concert premiere of the album. Stablo has been <a href="http://www.aquarius-publishing.com/2015/01/nine-romics-stablo-is-one-of-23-albums-up-for-european-independent-album-of-the-year-award/?lang=en">nominated</a> for IMPALA’s European Independent Album of the Year Award.</p>

		<p>For this project I collaborated with Croatia Records, Croatia’s largest record label in telling the story behind their release ‘Indie Compilation’. This involved filming interviews with all 12 artists featured on the compilation and editing over 25 hours of footage into a 7 minute documentary feature.</p>
